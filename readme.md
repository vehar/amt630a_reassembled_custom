## **AMT630A Firmware and Hardware Overview**
The **AMT630A** is a video processing chip commonly found in **mini TFT screens**, particularly those used in car rear-view monitors and retro gaming setups. While inexpensive and widely available, these displays **suffer from multiple issues**, prompting the community to explore firmware customization and hardware modifications.

### **Key Display Issues:**
- **Flickering & Interlacing**: Even with non-interlaced signals, vertical flickering occurs.
- **Image Resampling & Smearing**: 320×240 screens distort images due to resampling artifacts.
- **PAL60 Compatibility Issues**: Some screens exhibit color issues or fail to update scanlines.
- **Backlight Control**: No built-in brightness adjustment, requiring firmware/hardware modifications.
- **Commodore 64 & VIC-20 Signal Recognition**: The display often fails to sync properly.

## **Firmware Disassembly & Customization**
### **Reverse Engineering the Firmware**
- The AMT630A firmware is stored in an **external SPI flash chip**.
- The **chip runs on an 8031/8051-based microcontroller**.
- The firmware has been **disassembled** using tools like **no$x51**, allowing modifications.

### **Key Custom Firmware Enhancements**
- **Backlight Dimming**: Implemented **PWM brightness control** to reduce power consumption.
- **Low-Power Standby Mode**: Reduced current draw from **33mA to 8.4mA at 5V**.
- **Signal Compatibility Improvements**: Adjustments for **Commodore 64 and PAL60** support.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Fixes**: Removed timeouts and added **font outlines** for better visibility.

### **Programming Tools & Methods**
- **Flashing the Firmware**: Using SPI programmers like the **ST Nucleo** and **STLink utility**.
- **Building Firmware from Scratch**: Some users attempted **C compiler (SDCC) support**.
- **Writing to Flash Memory**:
  - Manual **byte-by-byte writes** via register `FDD0h` and `FDD1h` are possible.
  - **256-byte DMA writes** are recommended for efficiency and longevity.

## **Hardware Modifications**
### **Display Scaling & Resolution Adjustments**
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adjusting registers `FD0Ah`, `FCC5h`, `FCC4h` to shrink/stretch images.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Changing **ADC sampling frequency** (13.5–54 MHz) to adjust width.
- **Frame Rate Synchronization**: Ensuring the display refresh rate matches **incoming signals**.

### **SPI Flash Compatibility**
- **Some flash chips fail to save settings**, returning `FF FF FF` IDs.
- **Ensuring correct chip detection** is crucial for proper settings retention.

### **UART & External On-Screen Display (OSD)**
- The AMT630A **has a hidden UART** that runs at **38,352 baud**.
- It enables external devices (e.g., **Arduino**) to add **color OSD overlays**.
- This is useful for **FPV flight displays, GPS data, and system diagnostics**.

## **Troubleshooting & Community Findings**
### **Major Firmware Issues**
- **Loss of Settings on Reboot**: Some screens fail to retain settings due to **incompatible SPI flash**.
- **Misaligned Menus**: On some displays, the **OSD appears too far left**, cutting off menu options.
- **Brightness Control Issues**: Some firmwares **don't change brightness smoothly**, only adjusting at **0% or 100%**.
- **Accidental Setting Changes**: A user disabled **PPOWER in the menu**, causing a **gray screen lock-up**.

### **VIC-20 & Commodore Signal Issues**
- **The VIC-20's sync signal is irregular** during vertical sync, confusing the AMT630A.
- Solutions like [Raphnet’s sync fix](https://www.raphnet.net/divers/commodore64_sync_fix/index_en.php#1) help, but **incompatibilities remain**.
- **Oscilloscope captures of VIC-20 signals** were suggested for debugging.

### **Resolution Adaptation (800×400, 800×480, etc.)**
- Modifying `resolution_io_list_for_320x240` helped **adapt the firmware to new display sizes**.
- Users adjusted **frame timing constants** to ensure proper refresh rates.

### **Community Contributions**
- **Firmware Dumps**: Shared for **troubleshooting & restoring bricked displays**.
- **SDK Releases**: `AMT630A_DBell_SDK_V2.3_20150703` and `AMT630A_CAR_V2.3_20150528` help with custom development.
- **Hardware Projects**: One user successfully built a **5-inch portable console** using the AMT630A.
